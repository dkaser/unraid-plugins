    <Description>
        Tailscale is a VPN service that makes the devices and applications you own accessible anywhere
        in the world, securely and effortlessly. The service handles complex network configuration on 
        your behalf so that you don't have to. Network connections between devices pierce through 
        firewalls and routers as if they weren't there, allowing for direct connections without the 
        need to manually configure port forwarding.
        
        After installing, open the console and use the tailscale CLI to configure:
